🐍 Snake Game
A classic Snake game built using Python’s Turtle module. Guide the snake to eat food, grow longer, and avoid crashing into the walls or yourself!

🎮 How It Works
The snake moves continuously on the screen, controlled by arrow keys.

Food appears randomly on the screen.

When the snake eats the food, it grows longer and the score increases.

The game ends if the snake hits the wall or itself.

The scoreboard shows your current score during the game.
